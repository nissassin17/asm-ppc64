#Compare RISC vs CISC

[Source](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/)

- CISC

	+ High-level programming translator (compiler) has less work to do. Length of translated machine code is shorter and need less RAM required to store instructions.

- RISC

	+ Simple instructions, is executed within one clock cycle.

	+ Require less transistor of hardware space, make hardware cost down.

	+ All instructions is uniformed in one clock circle, piplelining is possible.

	+ Lack of software support (hard to maintenance).
